# VAM: A Teaching Target For GCC

VAM is a very simple byte-stream architecture.  It was a created for the book
"Introduction to Compiling Techniques: A First Course using ANSI C, Lex and
YACC" by J P Bennett (McGraw-Hill 1990, 1995, 2003. It provides a
demonstration target for the Very Simple Language (VSL) compiler in that book.

Here, we extend VAM, so it can be used in tutorial material about developing
GCC.  It's first appearance was at [FOSDEM
2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2713-how-to-bring-up-gcc-for-your-new-chip/).
Over time this material will be extended.
